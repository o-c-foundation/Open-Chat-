2. The current balance is displayed at the top of the modal
3. A warning will appear if your balance is running low

### Adding More Funds

If your balance is low:

2. Click "Add Funds" 
3. Follow the same process as initial funding

### Resetting Your Session Wallet

If you want to create a new session wallet:

1. Open the Session Wallet modal
2. Click "Reset Wallet" at the bottom
3. Confirm your decision in the popup
4. A new wallet will be generated (requiring funding again)

## Troubleshooting

### Transaction Errors

If a message fails to send:

1. Check your session wallet balance
2. Ensure you're connected to the correct testnet
3. Try adding more funds if balance is low

### Wallet Not Verified

If your wallet isn't being verified:

1. Check if the funding transaction is confirmed on the testnet
2. Refresh the page and try again
3. Try recreating the session wallet if issues persist

## Security Considerations

Remember that:

1. Your session wallet private key is stored in your browser's localStorage
2. This wallet should only be used with small amounts of testnet ETH
3. Never use this wallet type on mainnet or with real cryptocurrency
4. The session wallet is meant only for OpenChat testnet operations
